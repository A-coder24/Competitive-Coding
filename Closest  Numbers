Closest Numbers
Sorting is useful as the first step in many different tasks. The most common task is to make finding things easier, but
there are other uses as well. In this case, it will make it easier to determine which pair or pairs of elements have the
smallest absolute difference between them.
For example, if you've got the list , sort it as to see that several pairs have the minimum
difference of : . The return array would be .
Given a list of unsorted integers, , find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between
them. If there are multiple pairs, find them all.
Function Description
Complete the closestNumbers function in the editor below. It must return an array of integers as described.
closestNumbers has the following parameter(s):
arr: an array of integers
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer , the length of .
The second line contains space-separated integers, .
Constraints
All are unique in .
Output Format
Output the pairs of elements with the smallest difference. If there are multiple pairs, output all of them in ascending
order, all on the same line with just a single space between each pair of numbers. A number may be part of two pairs
when paired with its predecessor and its successor.

Sample Output 1
-520 -470 -20 30
Explanation 1
(-470) - (-520) = 30 - (-20) = 50, which is the smallest difference.

Sample Output 2
2 3 3 4 4 5
Explanation 2
Here, the minimum difference will be 1. Valid pairs are (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5). We print the elements of each pair,
space-separated on a single line.
