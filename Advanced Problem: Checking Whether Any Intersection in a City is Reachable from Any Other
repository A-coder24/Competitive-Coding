The police department of a city has made all streets one-way. You would like
to check whether it is still possible to drive legally from any intersection to
any other intersection. For this, you construct a directed graph: vertices are
intersections, there is an edge (𝑢, 𝑣) whenever there is a (one-way) street from
𝑢 to 𝑣 in the city. Then, it suffices to check whether all the vertices in the
graph lie in the same strongly connected component.
Problem Description
Task. Compute the number of strongly connected components of a given directed graph with 𝑛 vertices and
𝑚 edges.
Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 104
, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 104
.
Output Format. Output the number of strongly connected components.
